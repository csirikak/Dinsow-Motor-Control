# Dinsow Motor Control
This program allows for the control of a pair of hoverboard wheels with acceleration and deacceleration using the provided commands. Useful for a large robot.

Currently with this version, it is possible to control the mainboard using the Arduino, however the python version intended to replace the Arduino is not working. 

Instructions for flashing the mainboard can be found here:
https://github.com/NiklasFauth/hoverboard-firmware-hack/blob/master/README.md

Please flash using one of the provided files if you would like to skip having to compile them yourself.

Note: Check the logic voltage before connecting anything to the Aduino, the color coding is sometimes reversed.

To wire the board and Arduino look for the UART-L cable (The one next to the buzzer) and connect the GND and RX pins to the corresponding pins on the Arduino (GND, 6 and 11). Sometimes the color of the wiring is incorrect so please use a multimeter to verify (I fried an Arduino this way).

The Arduino sketch has been configured for one mainboard, uncomment the comments @ ln 431-432 to use two boards. Modification will be necessary if you want more than two.

Wheel ID 1,2 are for board 1
Wheel ID 3,4 are for board 2

# Instructions for control:
```
All speeds fall within 1000, -1000.
Enable wheel: wheel ID + EN
Set speed limit: wheel ID + SP + desired speed limit
Set acceleration rate: wheel ID + AC + desired rate
Set desired speed: wheel ID + V + speed

Get speed limit: wheel ID + GLMT
Get last requested speed: wheel ID + LST
Get acceleration rate: wheel ID + GAC
Get last actual speed: wheel ID + GSP
Disable wheel: wheel ID + DI
Emergency stop: STOP
```
